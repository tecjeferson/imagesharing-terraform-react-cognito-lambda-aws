/**
 * <p>Returns an array of celebrities recognized in the input image.  For more information, see Recognizing celebrities
 *     in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. </p>
 *          <p>
 *             <code>RecognizeCelebrities</code> returns the 64 largest faces in the image. It lists the
 *       recognized celebrities in the <code>CelebrityFaces</code> array and any unrecognized faces in
 *       the <code>UnrecognizedFaces</code> array. <code>RecognizeCelebrities</code> doesn't return
 *       celebrities whose faces aren't among the largest 64 faces in the image.</p>
 *
 *          <p>For each celebrity recognized, <code>RecognizeCelebrities</code> returns a
 *         <code>Celebrity</code> object. The <code>Celebrity</code> object contains the celebrity
 *       name, ID, URL links to additional information, match confidence, and a
 *         <code>ComparedFace</code> object that you can use to locate the celebrity's face on the
 *       image.</p>
 *          <p>Amazon Rekognition doesn't retain information about which images a celebrity has been recognized
 *       in. Your application must store this information and use the <code>Celebrity</code> ID
 *       property as a unique identifier for the celebrity. If you don't store the celebrity name or
 *       additional information URLs returned by <code>RecognizeCelebrities</code>, you will need the
 *       ID to identify the celebrity in a call to the <a>GetCelebrityInfo</a>
 *       operation.</p>
 *          <p>You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an
 *       image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the
 *       AWS
 *       CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not
 *       supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p>
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *          <p>For an example, see Recognizing celebrities in an image in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p>
 *          <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the
 *         <code>rekognition:RecognizeCelebrities</code> operation.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { RekognitionClient, RecognizeCelebritiesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-rekognition"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { RekognitionClient, RecognizeCelebritiesCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-rekognition"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new RekognitionClient(config);
 * const command = new RecognizeCelebritiesCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link RecognizeCelebritiesCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link RecognizeCelebritiesCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link RekognitionClientResolvedConfig | config} for RekognitionClient's `config` shape.
