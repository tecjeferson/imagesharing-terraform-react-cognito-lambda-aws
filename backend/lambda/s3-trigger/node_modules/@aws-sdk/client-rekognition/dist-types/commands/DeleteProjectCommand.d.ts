/**
 * <p>Deletes an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project.  To delete a project you must first delete all models associated
 *          with the project. To delete a model, see <a>DeleteProjectVersion</a>.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <code>DeleteProject</code> is an asynchronous operation. To check if the project is
 *          deleted, call <a>DescribeProjects</a>. The project is deleted when the project
 *          no longer appears in the response. Be aware that deleting a given project will also delete
 *          any <code>ProjectPolicies</code> associated with that project.</p>
 *          <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the
 *             <code>rekognition:DeleteProject</code> action. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { RekognitionClient, DeleteProjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-rekognition"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { RekognitionClient, DeleteProjectCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-rekognition"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new RekognitionClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteProjectCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteProjectCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteProjectCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link RekognitionClientResolvedConfig | config} for RekognitionClient's `config` shape.
